rQdia Rainbow
=======

This is an implementation of rQdia coupled with the [Data Efficient Rainbow method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05243) for Atari
games. The code by default uses the 100k timesteps benchmark and has not been
tested for any other setting.

Run the following command (or `bash run_rQdia.sh`) with the game as an argument:

```
python3 main.py --game ms_pacman
```

To install all dependencies, run `bash install.sh`.
